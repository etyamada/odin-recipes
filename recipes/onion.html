    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The onion (Allium cepa L., from Latin cepa meaning "onion"), also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2010.[2][3]: 21  Its close relatives include garlic, scallion, leek, and chive.[4]</p>
    <p>This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese bunching onion (Allium fistulosum), the tree onion (A. × proliferum), and the Canada onion (Allium canadense). The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species, but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions.[5] The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cut in half from root to tip.</li>
        <li>Peel onion halves.</li>
        <li>Lay an onion half on cutting board with cut face down and root away from you. Create parallel cuts starting from the close end and ending<em>before</em> it reaches the far side; this will keep the onion together for the next step.</li>
        <li>Rotate the onion half 90 degrees counterclockwise (for left-handed chefs, rotate 90 degrees clockwise) and create parallel cuts perpendicular to the cuts made in the previous step.</li>
        <li>When the root is reached, cut the remainder to the same size/shape as the diced onion pieces already made.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the other onion half.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
